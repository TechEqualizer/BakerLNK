# BakerLink Production Deployment Checklist

## 🚨 Critical Issues to Fix Before Production

### 1. **Linting Errors (216 errors found)**
- Run `npm run lint` to see all errors
- Most are missing prop-types validation
- Remove unused imports (React in many files)
- Fix unescaped entities in JSX

### 2. **Bundle Size Warning**
- Main bundle is 780KB (should be under 500KB)
- Implement code splitting for:
  - Theme components
  - Admin pages
  - Chart libraries
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components

### 3. **Console Statements (98 found)**
- Remove or replace with proper logging service
- Keep only critical error logging
- Consider using a logging library for production

## ✅ Completed Pre-Production Tasks

1. ✓ Build passes without compilation errors
2. ✓ Environment variables properly configured (using VITE_ prefix)
3. ✓ HTTPS enforced (no HTTP URLs found except localhost)
4. ✓ Security headers configured (in vercel.json)
5. ✓ Supabase integration with proper error handling

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. **Prepare Environment Variables**

For Vercel/Netlify, add these environment variables in the dashboard:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

### 2. **Deploy to Vercel**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### 3. **Deploy to Netlify**

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm i -g netlify-cli

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

Or use the Netlify dashboard:
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `dist`
4. Add environment variables

### 4. **Post-Deployment Verification**

- [ ] Test authentication flow (login/logout/signup)
- [ ] Verify themes load correctly
- [ ] Check all images load from Supabase storage
- [ ] Test form submissions
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Test with slow network (Chrome DevTools)

## 🔒 Security Checklist

- [x] Environment variables not exposed in code
- [x] HTTPS enforced
- [x] Security headers configured
- [x] Authentication required for protected routes
- [x] Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting configured (Supabase/Cloudflare)
- [ ] Regular dependency updates

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

### Immediate Actions
1. Enable gzip compression (handled by hosting provider)
2. Implement lazy loading for images
3. Add loading skeletons for better UX

### Future Improvements
1. Implement service worker for offline support
2. Add image optimization pipeline
3. Use CDN for static assets
4. Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Large Bundle Size** - Needs code splitting
2. **Many Linting Errors** - Mostly prop-types validation
3. **Console Statements** - Should be removed for production
4. **No Error Boundary** - Add global error handling

## 📱 Browser Support

Tested and supported on:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+
- Mobile Safari (iOS 14+)
- Chrome Mobile (Android 8+)

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:
1. Revert to previous deployment in hosting dashboard
2. Fix issues in development
3. Test thoroughly
4. Deploy again
